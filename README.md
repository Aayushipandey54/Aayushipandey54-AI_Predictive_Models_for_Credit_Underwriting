#Core Technologies Stack
1. Machine Learning Algorithms
Decision Trees: Build predictive models with decision-making rules.
Random Forest: Improves accuracy with multiple decision trees.
Logistic Regression: For binary classification tasks (e.g., predicting loan defaults).
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Efficient models like XGBoost and LightGBM for structured data.
Neural Networks: Deep learning models for identifying patterns in large, unstructured datasets.
2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Data Cleansing: Handle missing values and scale features.
Feature Selection: Identify key factors influencing creditworthiness.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce feature size while preserving information (e.g., PCA).
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Analyze unstructured data (feedback, documents) to assess risk.
4. Databases
SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL): Store structured data (credit history, loan amounts).
